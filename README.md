  <strong>Clone any website — design, <em>motion</em>, and <em>interaction</em> — two ways: a pixel-faithful <em>freeze</em> and a clean, componentized React + Tailwind <em>rebuild</em>.</strong><br>
  <em>Point it at a site. UIForge <b>freezes</b> it into a self-contained, pixel-faithful replica (its real CSS, fonts, and assets kept) — the offline oracle — and <b>rebuilds</b> it into an editable Vite + React + Tailwind project: sections and repeated blocks as real components, styles as Tailwind classes, content externalized, verified against the freeze. It captures the webfonts, CSS animations, hover states, and dropdowns, records canvas/WebGL heroes to video, samples JS motion, and reaches sites behind Cloudflare — then populates it with <b>your</b> content.</em>

## Two outputs from one capture

The old tension — *a faithful copy keeps the original CSS; clean code throws it away* — is resolved by producing **both**, and using one to verify the other:

| | what it is | for |
|---|---|---|
| **Freeze** (`uiforge-freeze`) | a self-contained, **pixel-faithful** replica — the site's real CSS, fonts, and assets kept, scripts stripped for determinism | an exact, offline copy — and the **oracle** the rebuild is measured against |
| **Rebuild** (`uiforge-export`) | a **clean, componentized** Vite + React + Tailwind project — sections & repeated blocks as components, styles as Tailwind classes, content externalized | building on the design, editing, shipping with **your** content |

The freeze renders identical to the live site (it *is* its CSS); the rebuild is diffed against that freeze — offline and deterministic — so componentization can't silently break fidelity.

## Copied, five ways

Five real sites, frozen from the capture alone — original (left) vs freeze (right):

## Install

**Prerequisites:** [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), **Node**, and
**Playwright** for the rendering tiers (`npm i -D playwright && npx playwright install chromium`).

```
/plugin marketplace add TaewoooPark/UIForge
/plugin install uiforge@uiforge
```

Or locally: `git clone https://github.com/TaewoooPark/UIForge.git && claude --plugin-dir ./UIForge`.

# Clone a site

## The command

```
/uiforge:clone <url│file.html> [--content path.md] [--react]
```

or just say it:

```
Clone the design of linear.app using the content in landing.md.
Make a site with the same design as stripe.com, but for my product (see product.md).
```

You give a **reference** (the design) and, optionally, **your content** (a markdown
file). UIForge produces a clean, editable build whose design is the reference's and
whose content is yours.

## The pipeline

### What comes across

| | captured | how |
|---|---|---|
| Structure · layout · geometry | ✓ | `getBoundingClientRect` per element |
| Color · gradient · shadow · border · radius | ✓ | `getComputedStyle` per element |
| Typography — the **real webfont** | ✓ | `@font-face` fetched server-side (past CORS) |
| Text — incl. **mixed inline** (links in a sentence) | ✓ | ordered `pre`/`text`/`post` per node |
| SVG icons & logos | ✓ | captured whole |
| **CSS animations** (spinners, entrances) | ✓ | `@keyframes` fetched server-side |
| **Hover / focus / active** states | ✓ | `:hover` rules → `.uif-<i>:hover` companion CSS |
| **Dropdowns / menus / accordions** | ✓ | clicked during capture → open-state + click runtime |
| **Scroll-reveal** states & lazy media | ✓ | full scroll-through before snapshot |
| **Canvas / WebGL** heroes | ✓ *(opt-in)* | `captureStream()` → a looping `<video>` |
| **JS motion** (Framer / GSAP) | ~ *(opt-in)* | sampled over time → approximating `@keyframes` |
| A **pixel-faithful** offline replica | ✓ | `uiforge-freeze` keeps the real CSS/fonts/assets |
| A **clean componentized** rebuild | ✓ | segment + tailwindify → `components/*.tsx`, Tailwind classes |
| **Self-contained** assets (offline) | ✓ *(opt-in)* | `export --assets` downloads img/font/bg → `/public` |
| **Responsive** (mobile) variants | ✓ *(opt-in)* | `--responsive` mobile pass → `max-sm:` classes |
| Sites behind **Cloudflare / bot walls** | ~ *(opt-in)* | `--headed` real-browser bypass (best-effort) |

Every value in the reconstruction is produced by the tools, not guessed — the
signature by `uiforge-theme`, the layout and styles by `uiforge-reconstruct`, the
match verified by `uiforge-diff`. And the clone is **QA'd for accessibility**
(`uiforge-render-audit`): the same look, but it passes the WCAG contrast the original
may not.

## How faithful is it, honestly

Measured (deterministic reconstruction, no hand-authoring), full-page pixel overlay of
reference vs reconstruction:

| site | nodes | similarity |
|---|---|---|
| a simple static page | 14 | **93%** |
| **vercel.com** | 425 | **95.8%** |
| **linear.app** | 1023 | **92.8%** |
| tailwindcss.com | 1122 | 71% |

**Clean and medium sites reproduce at 93–96%, and even a dense marketing homepage like
linear.app now lands at 92.8%** — nav, color, copy, and the headline in Linear's own
**Inter Variable** (recovered by re-declaring its `@font-face`) are effectively identical,
as the hero above shows. The number falls on the *longest, most layered* pages
(tailwindcss.com, ~11,000px) for one honest reason: the score is a **full-page pixel
overlay**, so it's dominated by **cumulative vertical drift** — flow layout can't perfectly
reproduce a section whose height came from absolutely-positioned art, and a few pixels per
section compound over a very long page. That metric actually *penalizes* a structurally
complete reconstruction versus a broken-but-shorter one, so read it as a floor, not a
ceiling: the visible design matches more closely than the tail number suggests. A running
**canvas/WebGL** hero (Vercel's spinning triangle) can't be *reproduced* from computed
styles — but it is now **recorded to a looping video** (`--record-canvas`), so it's in the
clone too; fonts and CSS motion, once on the "can't" list, aren't anymore. Reproduce any of this:
`node tools/uiforge-capture.mjs <url>` then
`node tools/uiforge-reconstruct.mjs capture.json` then `node tools/uiforge-diff.mjs <url> index.html`.

## Ethics — a redesign scaffold, not a passing-off clone

This makes a **design reproduction**: structure and styling, with **your** content and
substituted brand assets (logo, photos). Do not deploy it under the original's brand
(passing off), do not lift the original's copyrighted images or copy into a shipped
product, and never build a credential/login clone. Fonts follow their license.

# The tools

Ten command-line tools; every one prints `--help`. The capture/diff tiers are zero
external-dependency Node; rendering uses Playwright.

### Clone pipeline

```bash
node tools/uiforge-freeze.mjs    <url│file> [--out freeze.html] [--viewport WxH] [--headed]
      # the PIXEL-FAITHFUL oracle: inline the real stylesheets (fetched server-side, url()s
      # absolutized), strip scripts, keep the settled DOM. Renders identical to the live site.

node tools/uiforge-capture.mjs   <url│file> [--out capture.json] [--record-canvas] [--sample-motion] [--responsive] [--headed]
      # extract every element's exact computed styles, geometry, text, SVGs + a deduped token set.
      # Recovers real @font-face, @keyframes, :hover/:focus rules server-side (past CORS), explores
      # dropdown open-states, scrolls to fire reveals; emits a coverage manifest (found→captured→why).
      #   --record-canvas  record each <canvas> to a looping .webm     --sample-motion  JS motion → @keyframes
      #   --responsive     mobile pass → max-sm: variants + stability   --headed         clear a Cloudflare/bot wall

node tools/uiforge-theme.mjs     capture.json [--out-css theme.css] [--out-json theme.json]
      # infer semantic roles by usage → a Tailwind v4 @theme (bg/fg/muted/surface/border/accent)

node tools/uiforge-segment.mjs   capture.json [--out segment.json]
      # detect semantic sections + repeated components (structural hashing) — the componentization map
node tools/uiforge-tailwindify.mjs capture.json theme.json [--sample N]
      # map computed styles → Tailwind utility classes against the @theme (arbitrary [values] otherwise)

node tools/uiforge-export.mjs    capture.json --out-dir ./clone [--assets] [--flat]
      # DEFAULT: a componentized React + Tailwind project (components/*.tsx, content.ts, Tailwind classes)
      #   --assets  download images/fonts → /public, rewrite refs (self-contained)   --flat  the old single-file dump

node tools/uiforge-assets.mjs    capture.json --dest ./clone/public
      # download every external image/font/bg a capture references (bounded, self-contained)

node tools/uiforge-diff.mjs      <ref> <out> [--segments segment.json] [--json]
      # localized fidelity: per-section similarity + SSIM + structure (height/node) + element-presence
```

### Accessibility & craft QA (so the clone is better than a scrape)

```bash
node tools/uiforge-render-audit.mjs <url│file> [--spec sig.json] [--json]
      # per-node WCAG contrast, accent surface-area, spacing rhythm, type coherence, layout tells
node tools/uiforge-attention.mjs    <url│file> [--overlay out.png]
      # predict the gaze order + flag a flat hierarchy
node tools/uiforge-lint.mjs         <dir> [--strict]
      # the fast source gate: default fonts, AI purple, gradient headlines, hype copy…
```

---

# How it works

Ask any LLM to "build a site like Stripe" and it approximates from memory — the
result rhymes with Stripe but isn't Stripe. UIForge doesn't approximate. It **renders
the real page and measures it**: `getComputedStyle` on every element gives the exact
color, gradient, shadow, border, font, and box; `getBoundingClientRect` gives the
exact geometry; SVGs are captured whole. `uiforge-reconstruct` replays that verbatim,
so the baseline is faithful *by construction* — the styling is the site's own values,
not a guess. `uiforge-diff` then renders the reconstruction next to the original and
reports, region by region, where it still differs, and the loop closes those gaps.

The result is the opposite of "vibes": a copy you can measure (95.9% on vercel.com),
delivered as an editable React + Tailwind project with your content and the design
system extracted into an `@theme`.

## The design system, extracted

`uiforge-theme` doesn't just dump colors — it **infers roles by how they're used**:
the background is the color painting the most area, the foreground the most-used text
color that clears contrast, the accent the most-used saturated color. On linear.app it
recovered `bg #08090a`, `accent #6366f1` (their indigo), and the exact fonts (Inter
Variable + Berkeley Mono) — the real design system, as a Tailwind v4 `@theme` you own.

## Honest limits

- **Motion & interaction** *(largely captured — see the grid above)*: CSS animations,
  `:hover`/`:focus`/`:active`, dropdowns/menus/accordions, and scroll-reveal states all
  come across; canvas/WebGL is recorded to video and JS motion is sampled into keyframes
  (both opt-in). The **residuals**: menus that open via a *portal* (a new subtree elsewhere
  in the DOM) rather than restyling their own panel; toggles that live in a removed sticky
  header; **scroll-linked** timelines and physics-based motion (sampling loops them, it
  doesn't scrub them to scroll); and truly one-shot entrance animations that finished before
  capture. JS-motion sampling is *approximate* by nature — it reproduces
  translate/scale/rotate/fade, not a particle system.
- **Webfonts**: a font served *without* permissive CORS, or behind auth, still falls back to
  a system face — everything else renders in the real webfont.
- **One snapshot**: content behind auth and responsive breakpoints need extra captures (a
  mobile viewport is one flag).
- **"Clean" is staged**: the export's styling is inline from the capture (faithful,
  editable, theme extracted); lifting it to idiomatic Tailwind utilities and components
  is the `/clone` agent step, not yet fully automatic.
