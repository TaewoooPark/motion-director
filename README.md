## Three outputs from one site — *behave*, *look*, *edit*

Most tools give you a still. UIForge gives you the **behavior** first, then the look and the editable code:

| | what it is | for |
|---|---|---|
| **⭐ Archive** (`uiforge-archive`) | the **complete behavior** — the site's own code + every recorded response, replayed offline | a copy that **works**: tabs, filters, lists, client-side transitions, motion, scroll |
| **Freeze** (`uiforge-freeze`) | a self-contained, **pixel-faithful** still — real CSS/fonts/assets kept, scripts stripped, time frozen | an exact offline still — and the **oracle** the rebuild is measured against |
| **Rebuild** (`uiforge-export`) | a **clean, componentized** Vite + React + Tailwind project — components, Tailwind classes, content externalized | building on the design, editing, shipping with **your** content |

The **archive runs the real JavaScript** against cached data, so every interaction behaves exactly as the original — no reconstruction, because it *is* the behavior. (This is why it beats "Save As": a naive save of a modern app never records the XHR/API data the app fetches, so it opens as a broken shell — the archive records *and replays* that data.) The freeze renders identical to the live site (it *is* its CSS); the rebuild is diffed against that freeze — offline, deterministic — so componentization can't silently break fidelity.

---

## Cloned — and it actually *works*. Five flagship sites.

Each site below was **archived and replayed offline** by the plugin (`uiforge-archive --explore`). The GIFs are the clone running **with no network** — the interactions are genuine, driven by the site's own code against recorded data.

<table>

## Install

**Prerequisites:** [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), **Node**, and
**Playwright** for the rendering tiers (`npm i -D playwright && npx playwright install chromium`).

```
/plugin marketplace add TaewoooPark/UIForge
/plugin install uiforge@uiforge
```

Or locally: `git clone https://github.com/TaewoooPark/UIForge.git && claude --plugin-dir ./UIForge`.

---

# Clone a site

## The command — one command, three modes

```
/uiforge:clone <url│file.html> [--archive] [--react] [--content path.md] [--explore] [--headed] [--profile dir]
```

| you want… | say | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| a copy that **works / behaves** | `--archive`, or *"clone it so it actually works"* | ⭐ records the real code + data → an offline **replay** where tabs/filters/lists/transitions work |
| **editable** React with **your** content | `--react`, or *"…for my product (product.md)"* | a clean componentized React + Tailwind **rebuild** |
| a **pixel-faithful** still | *(default)* / `--freeze` | a self-contained **freeze** |

Or just say it — the agent picks the mode:

```
Clone vercel.com so it actually works — the tabs and pricing should switch.   → Archive
Make a site with the same design as stripe.com, but for my product (product.md). → Rebuild
Give me an exact offline copy of linear.app's landing page.                     → Freeze
```

**Behind Cloudflare or a login?** add `--headed --profile ./prof` (a persistent profile logs in once and reuses the session). The **Archive** mode always runs `--explore` — it clicks in-page controls and scrolls during capture so the data those interactions fetch is recorded; the more it explores, the more that works offline.

> Running the tools directly: **Archive** — `node tools/uiforge-archive.mjs <url> --out-dir ./archive --explore` then `node ./archive/serve.mjs`. **Rebuild** — `capture → theme → export --assets`. **Freeze** — `uiforge-freeze <url> --inline`. See [The tools](#the-tools).

## The pipeline

### What comes across

| | captured | how |
|---|---|---|
| Structure · layout · geometry | ✓ | `getBoundingClientRect` per element |
| Color · gradient · shadow · border · radius | ✓ | `getComputedStyle` per element |
| Typography — the **real webfont** | ✓ | `@font-face` fetched server-side (past CORS) |
| Text — incl. **mixed inline** (links in a sentence) | ✓ | ordered `pre`/`text`/`post` per node |
| SVG icons & logos | ✓ | captured whole |
| **CSS animations** (spinners, entrances) | ✓ | `@keyframes` fetched server-side |
| **Hover / focus / active** states | ✓ | `:hover` rules → `.uif-<i>:hover` companion CSS |
| **Dropdowns / menus / accordions** | ✓ | clicked during capture → open-state + click runtime |
| **Scroll-reveal** states & lazy media | ✓ | full scroll-through before snapshot |
| **Canvas / WebGL** heroes | ✓ *(opt-in)* | `captureStream()` → a looping `<video>` |
| **JS motion** (Framer / GSAP) | ~ *(opt-in)* | sampled over time → approximating `@keyframes` |
| A **pixel-faithful** offline replica | ✓ | `uiforge-freeze` keeps the real CSS/fonts/assets |
| A **clean componentized** rebuild | ✓ | segment + tailwindify → `components/*.tsx`, Tailwind classes |
| **Self-contained** assets (offline) | ✓ *(opt-in)* | `export --assets`, or `freeze --inline` → one data-URI file |
| **Responsive** (mobile) variants | ✓ *(opt-in)* | `--responsive` mobile pass → `max-sm:` classes |
| **Exact** JS animation (Framer / Motion) | ✓ | `Element.animate()` hook → real `@keyframes` + curve/stagger/fill |
| **Scroll-linked** animation | ✓ | native `ScrollTimeline`/`ViewTimeline` → `animation-timeline` |
| **Deterministic** on carousels / rotators | ✓ | time-frozen at the snapshot instant (Playwright clock) |
| Real **`<video>`** (hero / background) | ✓ | source + poster + loop/muted captured |
| Sites behind **Cloudflare / bot walls** | ✓ *(opt-in)* | `--headed --profile` (persistent `cf_clearance` + challenge wait) |
| Content behind a **login** | ✓ *(opt-in)* | `--profile` / `--storage-state` (saved session) |
| A **whole site** (many pages) | ✓ | `uiforge-site` crawls → one React-Router project |

Every value in the reconstruction is produced by the tools, not guessed — the
signature by `uiforge-theme`, the layout and styles by `uiforge-reconstruct`, the
match verified by `uiforge-diff`. And the clone is **QA'd for accessibility**
(`uiforge-render-audit`): the same look, but it passes the WCAG contrast the original
may not.

## How faithful is it, honestly

Measured (deterministic reconstruction, no hand-authoring), full-page pixel overlay of
reference vs reconstruction:

| site | nodes | similarity |
|---|---|---|
| a simple static page | 14 | **93%** |
| **vercel.com** | 425 | **95.8%** |
| **linear.app** | 1023 | **92.8%** |
| tailwindcss.com | 1122 | 71% |

**Clean and medium sites reproduce at 93–96%, and even a dense marketing homepage like
linear.app now lands at 92.8%** — nav, color, copy, and the headline in Linear's own
**Inter Variable** (recovered by re-declaring its `@font-face`) are effectively identical,
as the hero above shows. The number falls on the *longest, most layered* pages
(tailwindcss.com, ~11,000px) for one honest reason: the score is a **full-page pixel
overlay**, so it's dominated by **cumulative vertical drift** — flow layout can't perfectly
reproduce a section whose height came from absolutely-positioned art, and a few pixels per
section compound over a very long page. That metric actually *penalizes* a structurally
complete reconstruction versus a broken-but-shorter one, so read it as a floor, not a
ceiling: the visible design matches more closely than the tail number suggests. A running
**canvas/WebGL** hero (Vercel's spinning triangle) can't be *reproduced* from computed
styles — but it is now **recorded to a looping video** (`--record-canvas`), so it's in the
clone too; fonts and CSS motion, once on the "can't" list, aren't anymore. Reproduce any of this:
`node tools/uiforge-capture.mjs <url>` then
`node tools/uiforge-reconstruct.mjs capture.json` then `node tools/uiforge-diff.mjs <url> index.html`.

## Ethics — a redesign scaffold, not a passing-off clone

This makes a **design reproduction**: structure and styling, with **your** content and
substituted brand assets (logo, photos). Do not deploy it under the original's brand
(passing off), do not lift the original's copyrighted images or copy into a shipped
product, and never build a credential/login clone. Fonts follow their license.

# The tools

Ten command-line tools; every one prints `--help`. The capture/diff tiers are zero
external-dependency Node; rendering uses Playwright.

### Clone pipeline

```bash
node tools/uiforge-freeze.mjs    <url│file> [--out freeze.html] [--inline] [--headed] [--profile dir] [--shot ref.png]
      # the PIXEL-FAITHFUL oracle: inline the real stylesheets (server-side), strip scripts, freeze
      # time at the snapshot instant. --inline embeds every asset as data: URIs (one offline file);
      # --shot saves the live screenshot at that frozen instant (the aligned proof pair).

node tools/uiforge-capture.mjs   <url│file> [--record-canvas] [--sample-motion] [--responsive] [--headed] [--profile dir]
      # extract every element's exact computed styles, geometry, text, SVGs, real videos + a token set.
      # Recovers real @font-face, @keyframes, :hover/:focus rules + EXACT WAAPI keyframes (curve, stagger,
      # scroll-linked), explores dropdowns, freezes time; emits a coverage manifest (found→captured→why).
      #   --record-canvas  <canvas> → looping .webm     --sample-motion  rAF motion → @keyframes (fallback)
      #   --responsive  mobile → max-sm: + stability     --headed/--profile  clear a bot wall / a login session

node tools/uiforge-theme.mjs     capture.json [--out-css theme.css] [--out-json theme.json]
      # infer semantic roles by usage → a Tailwind v4 @theme (bg/fg/muted/surface/border/accent)

node tools/uiforge-segment.mjs   capture.json [--out segment.json]

node tools/uiforge-tailwindify.mjs capture.json theme.json [--sample N]

node tools/uiforge-site.mjs      <start-url> --out-dir ./site [--max 6] [--assets] [--headed] [--profile dir]
      # clone a WHOLE site: crawl same-origin pages, capture each, stitch into ONE React-Router
      # project (a route per page, namespaced components, one shared @theme). The "one page" limit, gone.

node tools/uiforge-archive.mjs   <url> --out-dir ./archive [--explore] [--headed] [--profile dir]
      # the COMPLETE behavior clone: record the real code + every network response (incl. XHR/API),
      # warmed by clicking in-page controls + scrolling → a folder + zero-dep replay server. Open it
      # and the site's own JS runs offline against cached data: tabs, filters, lists, transitions WORK.
      #   node ./archive/serve.mjs   → open the printed http://localhost URL
```

### Accessibility & craft QA (so the clone is better than a scrape)

```bash
node tools/uiforge-render-audit.mjs <url│file> [--spec sig.json] [--json]
      # per-node WCAG contrast, accent surface-area, spacing rhythm, type coherence, layout tells
node tools/uiforge-attention.mjs    <url│file> [--overlay out.png]
      # predict the gaze order + flag a flat hierarchy
node tools/uiforge-lint.mjs         <dir> [--strict]
      # the fast source gate: default fonts, AI purple, gradient headlines, hype copy…
```

# How it works

Ask any LLM to "build a site like Stripe" and it approximates from memory — the
result rhymes with Stripe but isn't Stripe. UIForge doesn't approximate. It **renders
the real page and measures it**: `getComputedStyle` on every element gives the exact
color, gradient, shadow, border, font, and box; `getBoundingClientRect` gives the
exact geometry; SVGs are captured whole. `uiforge-reconstruct` replays that verbatim,
so the baseline is faithful *by construction* — the styling is the site's own values,
not a guess. `uiforge-diff` then renders the reconstruction next to the original and
reports, region by region, where it still differs, and the loop closes those gaps.

The result is the opposite of "vibes": a copy you can measure (95.9% on vercel.com),
delivered as an editable React + Tailwind project with your content and the design
system extracted into an `@theme`.

## The design system, extracted

`uiforge-theme` doesn't just dump colors — it **infers roles by how they're used**:
the background is the color painting the most area, the foreground the most-used text
color that clears contrast, the accent the most-used saturated color. On linear.app it
recovered `bg #08090a`, `accent #6366f1` (their indigo), and the exact fonts (Inter
Variable + Berkeley Mono) — the real design system, as a Tailwind v4 `@theme` you own.

## Honest limits

Most of what used to be here is now handled (see the grid): exact JS animation, native
scroll-linked motion, determinism on carousels, real videos, webfonts (even CORS-locked, via
`--inline`), auth, Cloudflare, and whole-site crawl. The **honest residuals** that remain:

- **Behavior lives in the *archive*, not the freeze/rebuild.** JS-mounted heroes (openai's
  ChatGPT prompt), JS-driven scroll scrub, physics/particle motion, and any click-swaps-content
  interaction are only fully reproduced by **`uiforge-archive`**, which runs the real code. The
  freeze (scripts stripped) and the still rebuild capture the *state*, not the running logic.
- **The archive's own residual**: a *server*-dependent action (a search that hits an API, a
  "load more" that fetches) only works if that response was **recorded** — run `--explore` and
  interact more to widen coverage; a request never made during capture has nothing to replay.
- **"Idiomatic" is the last mile** (rebuild): it's genuinely componentized and Tailwind-classed,
  but mapping every arbitrary `[value]` to a design-token utility and naming components
  semantically is the `/clone` agent's polish step, not fully automatic.
